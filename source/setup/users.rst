Adding a User
-------------

Once you've initially installed Postgres you should be able to connect almost immediately with `psql -h localhost`. This will put you inside your database to begin working. Of course the next step before doing anything else is to create a user account for yourself.


.. code::SQL

craig=# CREATE USER craig WITH PASSWORD 'Password';
CREATE ROLE

New user `craig` is created with password `Password`.

Next step is to create a database and grant access to the user `craig`

.. code::SQL

craig=# CREATE DATABASE pgguide;
CREATE DATABASE

Now new database `pgguide` is created. Now we will grant access to `craig`.

.. code::SQL

craig=# GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE pgguide to craig;
GRANT

Now `craig` has all privileges on database pgguide. There are several different kinds of privilege: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, RULE, REFERENCES, TRIGGER, CREATE, TEMPORARY, EXECUTE, and USAGE.

.. code::SQL

craig=# GRANT SELECT ON DATABASE pgguide to craig;
GRANT

`GRANT SELECT` allows `craig` ONLY to do `select` query on database `pgguide`

[TBD: Add details about revoke]
