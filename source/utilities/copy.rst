What is copy
------------

Postgres ships with several great utilities for moving your data around. The
obvious ones are pg_dump and pg_restore for of course database backups and 
restores. A similar utility thats far less talked about, but equally as 
valuable is Postgres's copy utility. Copy allows you to do `copy` data into and
out of tables in your database. It supports several modes including:

  - binary
  - tab delimited
  - csv delimited

Whether its for bulk data loading for testing, doing some light weight ETL, or
simply grabbing a data extract to send to someone its a utility every developer
will want to utilize at some point.

Copy in Action
--------------

Extracting all employees to a tab delimited file:

.. code-block:: sql

   \copy (SELECT * FROM employees) TO '~/employees.tsv';

Extracting all employees to a csv delimited file:

.. code-block:: sql

   \copy (SELECT * FROM employees) TO '~/employees.csv' WITH (FORMAT CSV);

Extracting all employees to a binary file (note the quotes around the word Binary):

.. code-block:: sql

   \copy (SELECT * FROM employees) TO '~/employees.dat' WITH (FORMAT "Binary");

And for loading data into a table the equivalent for each of the above: 

.. code-block:: sql

   \copy employees FROM '~/employees.tsv';
   \copy employees FROM '~/employees.csv' WITH CSV;
   \copy employees FROM '~/employees.dat' WITH BINARY;
