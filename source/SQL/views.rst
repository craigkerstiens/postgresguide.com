What is a View
--------------

According to `wikipedia <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_%28database%29>`_
"a view consists of a stored query accessible as a virtual table in a relational 
database or a set of documents in a document-oriented database composed of the 
result set of a query or map and reduce functions."

In simpler terms a view is simply a logical table that automatically connects
the pieces of underlying data. It does not actually duplicate or persist the 
data as its viewed in a logical form.

Why use a View
--------------

Views are useful for many cases. Views are a great way to simplify your 
data model when providing it to others to work with. Additionally it can 
simplify working with your data for yourself as well. If you find yourself
routinely joining two sets of data in a similar way a view may ease the process
of duplicating that many times.

When working with others not familiar with SQL a view is a great way to provide
your un-normalized data.

A View in Action
----------------

Lets take an example of some tables:

To get your employees and their departments you'd often write a query that looks
something similar to:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT 
     employees.last_name, 
     employees.salary, 
     departments.department
   FROM 
     employees, 
     employee_departments,
     departments
   WHERE 
     employees.id = employee_departments.employee_id
     AND departments.id = employee_departments.department_id

In this case its not too complicated, though it does become tedious each time
you wish to report against employes and their departments. This can be greatly
simplified by creating a view which will automatically do these joins for you:

.. code-block:: sql
   
   CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employee_view AS
   SELECT 
     employees.last_name, 
     employees.salary, 
     departments.department
   FROM 
     employees, 
     employee_departments,
     departments
   WHERE 
     employees.id = employee_departments.employee_id
     AND departments.id = employee_departments.department_id

Now you can simply query your new table directly:

.. code-block:: sql

   SELECT *
   FROM employee_view

And have it yield just as it would with the join above:

.. code-block:: sql

   last_name    salary   department
   Jones        45000    Accounting 
   Adams        50000    Sales
   Johnson      40000    Marketing
   Williams     37000    Accounting
   Smith        55000    Sales
