Postgres Guide
==============

We here are very big fans of Postgres as a database and believe in many 
cases it is the best database for the job. For many though working with and
maintaining Postgres is a steep learning curve, though it doesn't have to be. 
Postgres guide is designed as a guide for beginners and experienced users to
find specific tips and explore tools available within Postgres. To improve the
ease of maintenance there's currently other great services to help with this
such as `Heroku Postgres <http://postgres.heroku.com>`_.

Some History
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Postgres has gotten much more attention in recent years. It has accelerated its
pace, meanwhile other RDMS's have slowed in releases. Though 
`Postgre SQL/PostgreSQL/Postgres <http://www.postgresql.org/>`_ has a very long history in databases, 
with its very name coming from one of the earliest databases Ingres 
(Post ingres = Postgres) and its own implementation beginning in `1986 <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/history.html>`_.
