# Postgres Guide

We from [**Postgree Guide**](http://postgresguide.com/) are very big fans of [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) as a database and believe it is often the best database for the job. For many though, working with and maintaining Postgres involves a steep learning curve. [This guide](http://postgresguide.com/) is designed as an aid for beginners and experienced users to find specific tips and explore tools available within Postgres.

If you want to take the quick & painless approach instead, there are great services available for Postgres hosting. In particular if you're need something more scalable for Postgres hosting take a look at [Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com).

Some History
------------

Postgres has gotten much more attention in recent years. It has accelerated its pace, meanwhile other RDMS's have slowed in releases. [Postgre SQL/PostgreSQL/Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) has a very long history in databases, with its very name coming from one of the earliest databases Ingres (Post ingres = Postgres) and its own implementation beginning in [1986](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.4/static/history.html).
